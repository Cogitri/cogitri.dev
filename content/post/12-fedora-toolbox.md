title: "Fedora Toolbox with custom container images"

Recently I've been using Fedora Toolbox a lot for development to have a reproducible
development enviroment across my different systems. To make it easier to have the
same container on multiple machines I've created my own Dockerfile:

<!--more-->

```
# Adjust the fedora version to the newest release here - I just happen to use F39 as of now
FROM registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:39

# Install extra packages
COPY extra-packages /
RUN dnf -y install $(<extra-packages)
RUN rm /extra-packages
```

It basically just uses the base image that's used for toolbox by default and installs
packages that are in the `extra-packages` file. Of course you can also add more things,
e.g. building other packages from source and so on. The `extra-packages` has one extra package
that should be installed per line, like this:

```
clang
fish
openssh-server
```

We can build the image by having the following folder structure:

```
$ ls
Dockerfile extra-packages
```

And issuing the following podman command:

```
podman build . -t $USER/fedora-toolbox:latest
```

Afterwards the toolbox with the custom image can be created with:

```
toolbox create -c fedora-toolbox-39 -i $USER/fedora-toolbox
```

And voilÃ , you can enter the new toolbox with `toolbox enter`! :)

## Hooking it up with VSCode

Since I'm using the VSCode flatpak I have to use the VSCode Remote extension to
access my Toolbox container. To do that we have to install a SSH server into our container.
You can do that by adding `openssh-server` to your `extra-packages`. Afterwards, you can configure
the server by adding the following lines to our Dockerfile:

```
RUN printf "Port 2222\nListenAddress localhost\nPermitEmptyPasswords yes\n" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config \
	&& /usr/libexec/openssh/sshd-keygen rsa \
	&& /usr/libexec/openssh/sshd-keygen ecdsa \
	&& /usr/libexec/openssh/sshd-keygen ed25519
```

We can start the SSH server on login by adding the following systemd service file to
`$HOME/.config/systemd/user/toolbox_ssh.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Launch sshd in Fedora Toolbox

[Service]
Type=longrun
ExecPre=/usr/bin/podman start fedora-toolbox-34
ExecStart=/usr/bin/toolbox run sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -D

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Afterwards we can enable & start the service with:

```
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now toolbox_sshd
```

We should also add an entry to our SSH client config to make SSH'ing in the container easier:

```
Host toolbox
	HostName localhost
	Port 2222
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

We have to disable `StrictHostKeyChecking` and `UserKnownHostsFile` since the host key
of the container will change every time we regenerate the container.

Afterwards we can SSH into our container by installing the `Remote - SSH` extension
in VSCode:

### Launching X11/D-Bus Applications in VSCode

By default, you won't be able to launch X11 or D-Bus applications in VSCode's
integrated terminal when using the "Remote - SSH" extension. To fix this,
you have to set the `DISPLAY` and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`. The easiest way
to set these to the right values is to enter your toolbox via your normal terminal
(as in not via SSH) and doing `echo $DISPLAY` and `echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`.
Afterwards add these values to your launch.json, for my project it looks like this:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "(lldb) Launch",
            "type": "lldb", // if you're not using the CodeLLDB extension for debugging but instead the C/C++ one, change this to cppdbg
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/build/src/dev.Cogitri.Health.Devel", // Change this to the path of your exe
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "env": {
                "DISPLAY": ":0",
                "DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS": "unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Afterwards launching applications via your debugger should just work. In case you receive an error message akin to `Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified`, you may have to allow the toolbox container to communicate with your X(wayland) Server with `xhost +si:localuser:$USER`.
